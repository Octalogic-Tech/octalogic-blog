### Short Summary

The nature of [York](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/York)'s plan was revealed in a flashback when she realized the [World Government](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/World_Government) would try to eliminate her too. In the present, as a [Blackbeard Pirates](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Blackbeard_Pirates) ship is approaching [Egghead](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Egghead), at [Elbaf](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Elbaf) a duel is set up between [Kid](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Eustass_Kid) and [Shanks](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Shanks), where the latter is easily victorious, and [Dorry](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Dorry) and [Broggy](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Broggy) destroy [Kid's ship](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Victoria_Punk), leaving the [Kid Pirates](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Kid_Pirates) completely annihilated.

### &#xA;&#xA;Long Summary

A few hours ago, [York](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Vegapunk/York) learned that the [World Government](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/World_Government) wants her dead too, but she fortunately has a plan to counter it. She orders the four [Seraphim](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Seraphim) to terminate everyone trapped in the lab except for herself, the [Stella](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Vegapunk), and their hostages. She does acknowledge that she is not strong enough to fend for herself should the others find out she was responsible for letting the Seraphim run amok, which is why she ordered [S-Snake](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/S-Snake) to [petrify](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Mero_Mero_no_Mi) her as if York had her guard down and then undo it when no one is looking. She then tells her the places in the lab she does not want destroyed before sending the Seraphim on their way. Unknown to everyone on the island, a ship belonging to the [Blackbeard Pirates](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Blackbeard_Pirates) arrives off the shore.

In [Elbaf](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Elbaf), several pirates loyal to [Shanks](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Shanks) tell [Eustass Kid](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Eustass_Kid) that he will have to go through all of them first if he ever wants to see Shanks. Kid is unconvinced that the pirates standing before him, captain "Ball Fingers" [Gerotini](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Gerotini) of the [Puddle Pirates](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Puddle_Pirates), bandleader "Memorial Blade" [Fugar](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Fugar) of the [Social Club](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Social_Club), and princess "Trembling" [Pururu](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Pururu) of the [Bourgeois Pirates](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Bourgeois_Pirates) are fleets of the [Red Hair Pirates](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Hair_Pirates), but [Killer](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Killer) reminds him that there are several big names in the fleet, so he should not let his guard down.

Shanks tells the other pirates to clear out so they do not get hurt as he boards his ship. He asks if Kid's wounds from [Wano](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Wano_Country) have fully healed but [Yasopp](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Yasopp) says he looks fine if he is willing to pick a fight. Shanks accepts this and asks for any updates on [Blackbeard](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Marshall_D._Teach), where he is told that he left [Hachinosu](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Hachinosu), with Shanks remarking he was sure he would pop up in Wano. After that, Shanks is given information on Kid, and he calls him a troublemaker. When Kid forms his railgun to launch Damned Punk at the fleet, Shanks [foresees](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Haki/Kenbunshoku_Haki#Future_Sight) the damage it will cause, warning the fleet to spread out and telling [Dorry](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Dorry) and [Brogy](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Brogy) to watch his rear while he moves for Kid's ship. Moving to stop Kid's attack, Shanks approaches the [Victoria Punk](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Victoria_Punk), catching Kid off-guard and instantly defeating him with Kamusari. The [Kid Pirates](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Kid_Pirates) panic out over their captain and [combatant](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Combatant) being taken down and beg Shanks not to kill Kid, even giving up their [Road Poneglyph](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Poneglyph) rubbings to appease him. Shanks, however, ignores them and jumps from the ship while Dorry and Brogy perform the combined attack Hakoku, completely destroying the Victoria Punk; they tell the Kid Pirates that if they point a loaded gun at someone's hometown, they better expect to meet the same fate.

The Kid Pirates fall into the sea, while the narration says that in Elbaf, the Kid Pirates, led by Eustass "Captain" Kid, who has a bounty of 3,000,000,000, were completely destroyed.
